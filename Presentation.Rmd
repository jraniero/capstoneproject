```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(shiny)
```

## Introduction
- Purpose: predict  most likely next word in a phrase or sequence
- Available on https://jraniero.shinyapps.io/TextPredictor/
- Code (app and preprocessing) on https://github.com/jraniero/capstoneproject 
- Algorithm based on Good - Turing Frequency Estimation
- Algorithm favours matches of longer n-grams

## Using the app

- Input a few words or a phrase under the "phrase" field
- Click on "Predict"
- The App will then show a histogram and wordcloud of the most likely word to follow
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot.png",dpi=300)
```

## Algorithm description
- Usage of prestored n-gram dictionnary of up to 5 words, with their frequency
- First preprocess user input (to lowercase, remove stopwords, numbers...)
- Looks for matches in the n-gram dictionnary, each match is scored
- Score is calculated as: frequency times the length of n-gram
- Higher score to longer n-grams
- Return the last words of each of the n-grams with highest score
- Fast: provides results in a few seconds

## Algorithm accuracy tests
- The algorithm was tested against a test set of 4000 phrases
```{r include=FALSE}
results<-readRDS("target_vs_predicted.rds")
ngrams<-readRDS(file.path("TextPredictor","ngrams_app.rds"))
results$number<-1
agg_results<-aggregate(number~target+predicted,data=results,FUN=sum)
agg_results<-agg_results[order(-agg_results$number,agg_results$target,agg_results$predicted),]
matches<-subset(agg_results,as.character(target)==as.character(predicted))
mismatches<-subset(agg_results,as.character(target)!=as.character(predicted))
```
- Exact matches `r sum(matches$number)`, mismatches`r sum(mismatches$number)` not exact predictions. 
- Exact prediction rate of `r sprintf("%.02f",100*sum(matches$number)/(sum(matches$number)+sum(mismatches$number)))`% (note rate does not account for synonym match)
- Given that there are `r length(unique(ngrams$last_word))` unique words in dictionnary,  probability of randomly picking right word is `r sprintf("%.03f",100/length(unique(ngrams$last_word)))`%
- Algorithm outperforms random selection, even without considering synonym matches
